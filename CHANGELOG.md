# Changelog

## Version 1.0

* Added `RequestKeyFlow` and counter-flow `ProvideKeyFlow`, which allows a node to request a new `PublicKey` for use in
  transactions. The key can be requested from a remote node, in which case `ProvideKeyFlow` is invoked, otherwise if the
  key is requested from the same node then the counter-flow is not invoked. The `Party` associated with the `FlowSession` 
  passed into `RequestKeyFlow` determines whether the request is to the same or a remote node. The `RequestKeyFlow` 
  has a constrcutor which allows CorDapp developers to request a new key for a specific externalId - this is typically
  used in conjunction with "accounts", e.g. if a new key needs to be requested from a particular account. The response
  from `ProvideKeyFlow` is by way of a proof that the `PublicKey` was generated by the remote node in question. Proofs
  are not required if a key is generated locally. The `RequestKeyFlow` also allows developers to request a proof for 
  a `PublicKey` which is already known. This should be done if a `PublicKey` is available but you wish to check that it
  does indeed belong to a particular node and that this node is still in possession of the corresponding `PrivateKey`. 
  Both the `RequestKeyFlow` and counter-flow `ProvideKeyFlow` add mappings from the newly created kry to the node which
  created it and if relevant, adds a mapping from the newly created public key to the external ID which was requested
  for it to be associated with.
* Added initiating versions of the above flows called `RequestKeyForAccount` and `RequestKeyForAccountResponder` for
  requesting a key for a specific account on a node. 
* Added `RequestKey` and `RequestKeyResponder` for requesting a new key from a specified node.
* Added `VerifyAndAddKey` and `VerifyAndAddKeyResponder` which are used to verify the creator of an existing key.
* Added `SyncKeyMppingFlow` and `SyncKeyMappingFlowHandler` which can be used to synchronise a list of confidential 
  identities, or all the confidential identities involved in a transaction. The set of flows determines which keys the
  counterparty has not yet already got mapped in their `IdentityService` then sends over key to party mappings for each
  of the missing ones. The counterpart node must then request proofs of ownership from the nodes which created the keys
  (which may be different to the node which initiated the synchronisation of the key mapping).
* Added initiating versions of the the sync key mapping lows called `SyncKeyMppingInitiator` and 
  `SyncKeyMappingHandlerResponder`.
